# TIC-TAC-TOE
The main aim of the project is to implement a game TIC TAC TOE.
Java Swing is used to design a dynamic game window of the game. Java core concepts are used for developing the logic of the game. The winning logic is written using basic decision-making statements. The game window is fully dynamic and can be resized. The game is controlled using mouse clicks.
There is a grid of 3X3 where the cross and zeros are placed. This is a two-player game and   each player places cross and zero on their respective turns. Winning scores of each player X and O is recorded. The grid is cleared using the reset button and the game window terminates through the exit button which displays the confirmation dialog before exiting the game.

## INTRODUCTION

Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.
The game is user friendly and easy to play using mouse clicks. The game Tic Tac Toe has been developed in Java eclipse workspace IDE for GUI enabled environment.
The game is fully interactive with resizable display screen controlled using mouse clicks. It can be reset using reset button and terminated using the exit button.

## MOTIVATION

TIC TAC TOE is a wonderful game in itself. It helps in developing planning skills as one need to plan out how they can build their own line of three cross or three zeros while also watching out for what their opponent is doing as they can block their opponent from winning.
This game helps to develop cognitive skills. This game allows the students to better align with their learning styles and interests and make them accountable.
This game has always been of great fascination to me. I have played it in pen-paper mode on the last pages of my notebooks so this gave me the motivation to create this game by utilizing my existing knowledge of Java Programming language and also learn the design segment that is Java Swing of this programming language. 

## SCOPE OF WORK

The game that I have implemented for now is a two player game. This game can be further optimised to become a single player user vs computer game by using the minimax algorithm.
The game is easy to play and can be controlled by simple mouse clicks. The game window is resizable and can be adjusted according to the user.
The cross and zero is shown in different colours so that it appears to be distinct. Count is maintained so the game can be played as a series of matches to find out who wins the maximum number of times.

## OBJECTIVE

The main objective behind implementing this game is to apply my basic knowledge of java programming and also learn the new aspect of this that is Java Swing which is used to create interactive environment. 
Java Swing facilitates both designing of the game by using the various tools present and the code gets generated by the IDE. Whereas we can also code which creates the layout in return.

## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

### SOFTWARE USED:
        1. ECLIPSE -WORKSPACE IDE (Version 2021-12)
        2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
        3. Java Development Kit (JDK)

### JAVA CONCEPTS USED:
        1. Java core
        2. Java Swing
### TOOLS:
        SWING DESIGNER
        1. Application Window
        2. JDialog	
        3. JFrame
        4. JInternalFrame
        5. JPanel

## VARIOUS TOOLS USED:

1. JFrame: The game layout has been created using a frame which is a dynamic container which can be easily resized.
2. JPanel: The layout is divided into 15 panels
3. JButton: There are 9 JButtons for the nine boxes of the tic tac toe.
1.	One reset button to clear the game.
2.	One exit button to exit the game.
4. JLabel: There are two label fields that show the name of two players of the game as PlayerX and PlayerO.
5. JText: This is used to maintain the score board for both the players.

## HOW TO PLAY?? 

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENT

Future enhancement can be done in this game by implementing the minimax algorithm.
Let us combine what we have learnt so far about minimax and evaluation function to write a proper Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Artificial Intelligence) that plays a perfect game. This AI will consider all possible scenarios and makes the most optimal move.
